      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a data-driven economist with over eight years of experience in applied research, currently working at the University of Geneva. My work focuses on applied economics, with a particular interest in international trade, industrial organization, development economics, and quantitative social science. I am well-equipped to address complex policy and business challenges and deliver actionable insights by employing advanced causal inference methods and mixed-methods research on large datasets.

With a strong background in statistics and econometrics, I am proficient in Python, R, Stata, SQL, Google BigQuery, and Power BI. I am also expanding my expertise in natural language processing, predictive modeling, and causal inference in machine learning. My passion for data science further complements my skills, ensuring I remain at the cutting edge of business analytics and policy evaluation.

Beyond my professional work, I volunteer as an advisor for a nonprofit dedicated to improving the lives of marginalized children in West Bengal. Outside of work, I stay informed about current geopolitical developments and am passionate about sports, travel, and experimenting in the kitchen with global flavors.

I am currently seeking opportunities as an applied economist, research analyst/economist, data scientist, data analyst, or policy analyst—roles where I can merge my technical skills with strategic insight to enable impactful, evidence-based decision-making that produces tangible outcomes.
